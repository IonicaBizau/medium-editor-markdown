                    <p>You know, the <strong>Medium Editor</strong> library is awesome. Just great. But there is a missing feature that some people would like to have.</p>
                    <p>It's called <em>Markdown</em>. <a href="https://github.com/IonicaBizau">@IonicaBizau</a> created a Medium Editor extension that adds this missing feature.</p>

                        <p>In 1946, when Hopper was released from active duty, she joined the Harvard Faculty at the Computation Laboratory where she continued her work on the Mark II and Mark III. Operators traced an error in the Mark II to a moth trapped in a relay, coining the term bug.</p>
                        <p>This bug was carefully removed and taped to the log book. Stemming from the first bug, today we call errors or glitches in a program a bug.</p>
