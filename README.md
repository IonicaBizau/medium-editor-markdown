> A Medium Editor extension to add markdown support.






[Click here](https://github.com/daviferreira/medium-editor) to see the Medium Editor project.
















## Usage


The available scripts are:


 - me-markdown.no-deps.js
 - me-markdown.no-deps.min.js
 - me-markdown.standalone.js
 - me-markdown.standalone.min.js


The `*.standalone.*` scripts contain all the dependencies included there.

The `*.no-deps.*` scripts contain only the extension code. You will have to include manually [`turndown.js`](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown) on the page, before including the markdown extension.

The `*.min.*` scripts are minified.

## :memo: Documentation


### `MeMarkdown(options, callback)`
Creates a new instance of `MeMarkdown`.

#### Params

- **Object** `options`: An object containing the following fields:
 - `events` (Array): An array with the events when the markdown code will be generated (default: `["input", "change"]`).
 - `subscribeToMeEditableInput` (Boolean): If this is true we will respond to the medium editor's custom "editableInput" event
 - `callback` (Function): The callback function. If the second argument is a function, then it has greater priority.
 - `toTurndownOptions` (Object): Options to pass to the markdown converter code.
 - `ignoreBuiltinConverters` (Boolean): If `true`, the default converters passed to `toMarkdown` will be ignored.
- **Function** `callback`: The callback function that is called with the markdown code (first argument).

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects
I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:


 - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone).
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
